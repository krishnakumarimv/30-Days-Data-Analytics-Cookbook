# Day 02 – Types of Data Analytics: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive

## Overview

This folder is part of the **30 Days of Data Analytics – Practical Cookbook Series**.

**Day 02** explains the **four fundamental types of data analytics** and how each type supports a *different level of decision-making*.
Rather than treating analytics as a single activity, this day clarifies how analytics **matures from reporting to decision intelligence**.

The content is grounded in **operational and public-sector realities**, where incorrect use of analytics often leads to reactive decisions and misplaced confidence.

## What This Day Covers

* Why all analytics is not the same
* The progression from descriptive to prescriptive analytics
* The decision questions each analytics type answers
* Practical implications of stopping at reporting or dashboards
* How analytics maturity is organizational, not technological

## Dataset Used

**NYC 311 Service Requests (Kaggle)**

The dataset is used to demonstrate how:

* Descriptive analytics summarizes complaint volumes
* Diagnostic analytics explains growth drivers
* Predictive analytics anticipates future demand
* Prescriptive analytics guides operational action

This dataset closely resembles grievance redressal systems used in **urban governance and municipal operations**.
