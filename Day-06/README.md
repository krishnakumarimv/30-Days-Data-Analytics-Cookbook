# Day 6 – Core Analytics Skills

## Why Tools Do Not Create Analytics Capability

This day focuses on the **human and analytical skills** that determine whether data analytics produces meaningful decisions or merely generates reports.

While previous days established *what analytics is* and *how data behaves*, Day 6 addresses **who actually makes analytics work**.

## Objective

To demonstrate that effective analytics is driven by:

* problem framing,
* analytical thinking,
* interpretation,
* and responsible decision alignment,

not by tools or algorithms alone.

## Dataset Used

**NYC 311 Service Requests Dataset (Kaggle)**

This dataset is reused intentionally to show that **new insights emerge from skills, not new data**.
It closely resembles grievance redressal and service management systems used in urban governance.

## Core Skills Demonstrated

The accompanying notebook maps each skill to practical analysis:

1. **Problem Framing**
   Defining decision-oriented questions before touching data.

2. **Data Literacy**
   Understanding data origin, meaning, and limitations.

3. **Data Handling**
   Cleaning, filtering, and structuring data responsibly.

4. **Statistical Thinking**
   Recognizing concentration, trends, and variability.

5. **Visualization for Reasoning**
   Using charts to support decisions—not decorate dashboards.

6. **Interpretation**
   Connecting analytical patterns to real-world processes.

7. **Communication**
   Translating insights into clear decision implications.

8. **Ethics and Responsibility**
   Recognizing bias, misinterpretation risks, and governance impact.

## Contents

* `Day_06_Core_Analytics_Skills_Cookbook.ipynb`
  A skills-focused Jupyter notebook showing how core analytics capabilities appear in real analysis.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of Day 6, readers should understand:

* Why analytics maturity is primarily a **people capability**
* How the same dataset can produce vastly different outcomes
* Why interpretation and communication matter more than model complexity
* How analytics supports, rather than replaces, decision-makers

## How This Fits in the Series

Day 6 bridges **data concepts** and **organizational reality**.

It prepares readers for:

* recognizing analytics failures (Day 7),
* and later applying advanced techniques responsibly.

This day ensures analytics remains **decision-driven, explainable, and trustworthy**.

## Intended Audience

* Analytics beginners seeking strong foundations
* Public-sector and governance professionals
* Managers responsible for data-driven decisions
* Practitioners tired of tool-centric analytics narratives
