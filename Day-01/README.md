# Day 01 – What Is Data Analytics? Why It Matters in Decision-Making

## Overview

This folder is part of the **30 Days of Data Analytics – Practical Cookbook Series**.

**Day 01** focuses on establishing a clear, operational understanding of **what data analytics truly is**—not as dashboards or reports, but as a **decision-enabling discipline**.

The content bridges the gap between **raw data and actionable decisions**, using a **real-world public dataset** that closely mirrors grievance redressal and service management systems used in urban governance.

## What This Day Covers

* What data analytics means in practice
* Why data availability alone does not improve decisions
* The end-to-end analytics flow: data → insight → action
* Common misconceptions around reporting vs analytics
* How analytics changes *outcomes* without changing the data

## Dataset Used

**NYC 311 Service Requests (Kaggle)**
A large-scale citizen service request dataset used to demonstrate:

* Operational data realities
* Data quality challenges
* Trend and seasonality patterns
* Decision-relevant insights

The dataset structure is similar to complaint and service request systems used in municipal and public-sector environments.
