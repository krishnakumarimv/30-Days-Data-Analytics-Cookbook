# 30 Days of Data Analytics – Cookbook Series  
## From Data to Decision-Ready Insights

This repository contains a **30-day, hands-on Data Analytics series** focused on
**practical decision-making**, not just tools or dashboards.

Each day includes:
- a clear analytical concept,
- a real-world explanation,
- a **Jupyter Notebook cookbook** using an operational dataset,
- governance and decision-oriented insights.

The series progresses from **foundations → applied analytics → decision systems**.

## Why This Series Exists

Many analytics initiatives fail despite good tools and skilled teams.

The reasons are consistent:
- unclear decision questions,
- poor data quality,
- confusion between data, information, and insight,
- dashboards that do not influence action.

This series addresses those gaps by treating analytics as a **decision discipline**, not a reporting exercise.

## Dataset Used Across the Series

**NYC 311 Service Requests (Kaggle)**  

Chosen because it closely resembles:
- municipal grievance redressal systems,
- public service delivery platforms,
- large-scale operational databases.

Using the same dataset across days demonstrates how **analytics depth evolves**, even when data remains constant.
