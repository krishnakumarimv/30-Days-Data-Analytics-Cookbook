# Day 03 – Data vs Information vs Insights

## Overview

This folder is part of the **30 Days of Data Analytics – Practical Cookbook Series**.

**Day 03** addresses one of the most common reasons analytics initiatives fail:
the inability to distinguish between **data**, **information**, and **insights**.

Many organizations collect vast amounts of data and generate numerous reports, yet decision-making remains unchanged. This day explains *why that happens* and *how analytics must evolve* to become decision-relevant.

## What This Day Covers

* What raw data represents in operational systems
* How information is created through aggregation and structure
* Why information alone does not influence decisions
* How insights connect patterns to actions
* Why dashboards often fail to create impact

## Dataset Used

**NYC 311 Service Requests (Kaggle)**

The dataset is used to demonstrate how:

* Raw complaint records represent **data**
* Aggregated trends represent **information**
* Interpreted patterns tied to decisions become **insights**

This dataset mirrors grievance redressal and service-delivery systems commonly used in **urban governance and public administration**.

### Notebook Highlights

The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates:

* Raw data inspection without interpretation
* Structuring and aggregating data over time
* Identifying dominant patterns and concentrations
* Translating patterns into decision-relevant insights
* Governance-oriented interpretation of results

The emphasis is on **thinking discipline**, not technical complexity.

## Intended Audience

This material is designed for:

* Public-sector and urban governance professionals
* Decision-makers relying on reports and dashboards
* IT and MIS officers supporting analytics initiatives
* Data analysts and beginners learning applied analytics
* Students seeking real-world analytics context

No advanced statistical or machine learning knowledge is required.

## Key Takeaway

> Data creates awareness.
> Information creates understanding.
> Insights change decisions.

Analytics delivers value **only when it reaches the insight stage**.

## How to Use This Content

* Run the notebook step-by-step to see value transformation
* Use it to evaluate whether your reports create insights
* Apply the same logic to operational or governance datasets
* Use as training material for analytics literacy programs
